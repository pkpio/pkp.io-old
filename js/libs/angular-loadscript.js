/*
 *  Angular LoadScript
 *
 *  Let angular load and execute lazy javascript from partials!
 *
 *  This module is the result of  this issue: "1.2.0rc1 regression: script tags not loaded via ngInclude"
 *  Issue url: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3756
 *
 *  As of Angular 1.2.0 the ngInclude scripts does not permit execution of javascript from included partials.
 *  This little module execute code inside script tags with "javascript-lazy" attribute after partial loading,
 *  thus re-enabling this feature.
 *
 *  ( please have a look at the issue comments, this angular feature was never planned nor included properly,
 *  was only a drawback of using jQuery for partial inclusion )
 *
 *  This angular module have been created by @endorama (https://github.com/endorama) based upon the code
 *  posted by @olostan (https://github.com/olostan)
 *
 *  Simply add this file, load ngLoadScript module as application dependency and use type="text/javascript-lazy"
 *  as type for script you which to load lazily in partials.
