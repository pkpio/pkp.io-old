Yet another time, I'm starting a new blog. This time it's using jekyll but not in the usual way it is supposed to be used.


What changed?
---------
- It's all json output after a ```jekyll build```
- The idea is to use these json outputs in AngularJs
- Integrate it uniformly into the existing website
- The whole setup is actually a tidious task :/
